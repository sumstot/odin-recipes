            I'll show you my way which uses spices and chicken to elevate this humble dish.

            <li>Add black beans and chicken to the cheese on the tortilla</li>

            <li>Put butter into a hot cast iron skillet or stainless steel frying pan.</li>

            <li>Finally, take it out of the pan, cut, and serve with sour cream and guacamole.</li>
